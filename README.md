# Funnel Analysis
In this project, I conducted a sales funnel analysis using website event data to identify user drop-off points and optimize the conversion process.

**ðŸ”¹Key Responsibilities:
**Data Exploration & Cleaning
**Queried and analyzed the raw_events table to understand user interactions.
**Removed duplicate events to ensure data accuracy, keeping only the first occurrence of each event per user.

**ðŸ”¹Funnel Construction & SQL Querying
- Identified key user actions (e.g., product view, add to cart, checkout) to define a structured funnel. Selected 4-6 key user events to construct a meaningful funnel.
- Wrote SQL queries to aggregate event data and measure user progression at each stage.
- Segmented users by top 3 countries to compare funnel performance across different regions.

**ðŸ”¹Data Visualization & Business Insights
-Built a funnel chart to track conversion rates and user drop-offs.
-Calculated percentage drop-off per stage to pinpoint bottlenecks in the user journey.
-Provided insights and recommendations to improve customer retention and conversion rates.

**ðŸ”¹Business Impact:
**Identified key friction points in the checkout process that could lead to revenue loss.
**Suggested data-driven strategies to enhance user experience and optimize conversions.
